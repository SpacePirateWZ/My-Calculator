****COMPLETED****

1) Calculator able to append number at the end of previous number to form a value on the display screen

2) Calculator able to perform the following functions:
- clear display screen after clicking 'AC' button
- perform basic operations like add, subtract, multiple, and divide after clicking on respective buttons followed by pressing the 'equal' button each time to compute

3) Added limitations to allow '.' to be entered only once. As for '0', it can be entered only once if it is the 1st digit, but allowed to add on for subsequent digits as long as the 2nd digit is not '0'

****PENDING FUNCTIONS TO ADD / BUGS TO FIX/ FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS****

1) Operator functions to add:
- posneg (convert current value to positive/negative when clicked)
- percent (divide current value by 100 when clicked)

2) Currently Operator functions will only generate result when click on 'equal' button and supposingly after pressing 'equal' button, clicking the number button should restart the display screen instead of appending to the result

3) To allow calculator to perform computation and display result on screen when user click on any operator buttons apart from 'equal' button

4) Calculator still unable to cater for exponential value and output NaN when it reaches a certain threshold

5) Addition of backspace button to allow user to remove entered number
