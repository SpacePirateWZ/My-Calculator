To consider:
1) default value of screen is always set at zero
2) clicking each number will add the entered number to the end of the value
3) functions of each button are as follows:

AC - reset screen value back to zero
posneg - change current entered value to positive/negative
percent - essentially just divide by 100
/ --> divide the next entered value after clicking any function2 buttons
* --> multiply the next entered value after clicking any function2 buttons
- --> subtract the next entered value after clicking any function2 buttons
+ --> add the next entered value after clicking any function2 buttons
= --> complete the last function2 operation
(Note that the one difference between equal and other function 2 buttons is that after clicking equal, clicking a number will reset the number back to the entered number, meaning that previous number accumulated will be dumped. Unless user click on other function1/function2 buttons in which case the previous number will continue to be affected)

4) maximum number of digits to display on screen is 9
5) allow for exponential value but beyond a certain threshold will become NaN
6) if get infinity will display undefined or something funny
7) pressing keyboard also will interact with the calculator apart from clicking (extra)
